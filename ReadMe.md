## GBBleepBloops - Sonic feedback for delightful interfaces

* Opinion #1: There should always be the option to turn off all sounds.
* Opinion #2: Things should not bleep or bloop unless they really mean it, or it brings joy even 1,000 plays later.
* Opinion #3: Never force the interaction to wait on the effect.
